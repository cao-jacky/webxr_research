# webxr_research

This repository contains two submodules, `cowebxr` and `janus_sfu_edge`. In short, `cowebxr` is a fork and extension of the `networked-aframe` repository with some additional collaboration features such as the ability for one user to act as a support user whilst another uses the application like a typical augmented reality user. Then, `janus_sfu_edge` contains scripts which can take video or audio streams from the `cowebxr` application and apply "real-time" analysis, i.e., YOLO object detection.
